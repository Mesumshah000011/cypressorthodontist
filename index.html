        <h1>How Long Do Root Canals Take?</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Here's What a Cypress Orthodontist Might Tell You</p>
    </header>
    
    <div class="content">
        <div class="section">
            <p>Been told you need a root canal? The first thing that probably popped into your head was, "How long do root canals take?" Right after that, you might wonder if your  <b><a href="https://cypresstownedental.com/">Cypress orthodontist</a></b> can help. Let's break it all down in plain English. We'll walk through how the process works, what's involved, and how much time you're really looking at.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>What's a Root Canal Anyway?</h2>
            <p>A root canal is a way to save a tooth that's in trouble. When the soft tissue inside your tooth (called the pulp) gets infected, it needs to go. That pulp holds nerves and blood vessels, so when it's inflamed or damaged—yeah, it hurts.</p>
        
            
            <p>Infection can happen from deep cavities, cracks, or even a hard hit to the face. Once the pulp is removed, your dentist cleans the inside, fills it, and seals it so the pain doesn't come back.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>So, Really—How Long Do Root Canals Take?</h2>
            
            <h3>The Average Time Frame</h3>
            <p>Usually, root canals take between 60 and 90 minutes. But it depends on a few things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which tooth needs the work</li>
                <li>How bad the infection is</li>
                <li>How many canals the tooth has</li>
                <li>If it's all done in one go or over two visits</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>One Visit or Two?</h3>
            <p>Some root canals are quick. Others take a little more time. Here's how that works.</p>
            
            <div class="timeline-comparison">
                <div class="timeline-card">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-tooth icon"></i> One-Visit Root Canal</h3>
                    <p>Front teeth are simple. They usually have just one canal. That makes things faster and easier for your dentist.</p>
                    <div class="duration">About 60 minutes</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="timeline-card">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-teeth icon"></i> Two-Visit Root Canal</h3>
                    <p>Back teeth—like molars—are more complicated. They can have three or four canals, and they're harder to reach.</p>
                    <div class="duration">Two visits of 60-90 minutes each</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Why Two Visits?</h3>
            <p>Here's why your dentist might spread it out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Serious infection needs more time</li>
                <li>Healing needs to be monitored</li>
                <li>All canals must be 100% clean before they seal the tooth</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Actually Happens During a Root Canal?</h2>
            <p>If you've never had one, it might sound scary. But honestly? It's not that bad. Most people are surprised by how smooth it goes. Your dentist—or even your Cypress orthodontist if you're already in treatment—will talk you through it.</p>
            
            <div class="procedure-steps">
                <div class="step-card">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <h3>X-rays and Exam</h3>
                    <p>First, the dentist checks out the tooth with an X-ray. That helps them see the root and figure out what's going on inside.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Numbing the Area</h3>
                    <p>You'll get a local anesthetic so you don't feel pain. You might still feel some pressure, but that's it.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Cleaning It Out</h3>
                    <p>The dentist makes a small opening, removes infected pulp, shapes the canals, and rinses with special solutions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step-card">
                    <div class="step-number">4</div>
                    <h3>Sealing the Tooth</h3>
                    <p>Once clean, the dentist fills the canals with a rubbery material and seals the tooth with a filling.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step-card">
                    <div class="step-number">5</div>
                    <h3>Placing a Crown</h3>
                    <p>For chewing teeth like molars, a crown might be added later to protect and strengthen the tooth.</p>
                </div>

        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Can a Cypress Orthodontist Do Root Canals?</h2>
            <p>The short answer? <strong>No.</strong> That's not their area.</p>
            <p>A Cypress orthodontist focuses on straightening teeth and fixing bite problems. Root canals are done by general dentists or endodontists. Still, if you're getting braces or Invisalign, your orthodontist can work closely with your dentist. They'll make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
            <p>They'll also refer you to someone they trust if you need treatment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i> Does It Hurt?</h3>
            <p>That's the big fear. But truth is, modern root canals don't hurt. With today's tools and numbing medicine, the procedure feels kind of like getting a filling. Most people feel sore for a day or two, but it's manageable. You can usually control the discomfort with pain relievers from the drugstore.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recovery Time After a Root Canal</h2>
            <p>You'll be back to your usual routine pretty fast. Some people return to work or school the same day.</p>
            
            <h3>What You Might Feel After</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mild soreness or pressure</li>
                <li>Some sensitivity when you chew</li>
                <li>A little tired if you were stressed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Avoid chewing with the treated tooth until your dentist says it's safe. And don't skip your follow-up visit—especially if a crown is in the plan.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>How Root Canals Fit into Orthodontic Treatment</h2>
            <p>Sometimes a root canal is needed before or during orthodontic work. It's better to fix any dental issues early. If you try to move an infected tooth, you can end up with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain and swelling</li>
                <li>Delays in your treatment</li>
                <li>Bone damage near the root</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's why a check-up before starting braces is important. Your orthodontist wants every tooth healthy and ready to move.</p>
